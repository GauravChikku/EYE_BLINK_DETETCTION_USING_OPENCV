# Blink Detection with OpenCV and cvzone

This project uses OpenCV and cvzone to detect blinks using a webcam. The application leverages the FaceMesh module to identify facial landmarks and determine the blink ratio based on eye movements. The detected blinks are counted and displayed in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Blink Detection:** Uses a webcam to capture live video and detect blinks.
- **Face Mesh Detection:** Utilizes the FaceMesh module from cvzone to detect facial landmarks.
- **Blink Ratio Calculation:** Computes the blink ratio based on the distance between specific eye landmarks.
- **Blink Counter:** Displays the number of detected blinks on the screen.
- **Live Plot:** Visualizes the blink ratio over time using a live plot.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blink-detection.git
cd blink-detection
```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

```bash
python blink_detection.py
```

2. **Instructions:**

- Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
- The script will open a window displaying the live video feed from your webcam.
- The facial landmarks for the eye region will be highlighted.
- The blink count will be displayed on the screen.
- The live plot will visualize the blink ratio in real-time.

3. **Exit the script:**

- Press `q` to exit the application.

## Code Explanation

The main components of the script include:

1. **Webcam Initialization:**
    - The script initializes the webcam capture using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.

2. **Face Mesh Detection:**
    - The `FaceMeshDetector` from cvzone is used to detect facial landmarks.

3. **Blink Ratio Calculation:**
    - The vertical and horizontal distances of the eye are computed to determine the blink ratio.
    - The ratio is calculated and stored in a list for averaging.

4. **Blink Detection Logic:**
    - The script detects a blink based on the calculated ratio.
    - A blink is counted when the ratio drops below a certain threshold.

5. **Visualization:**
    - The blink count and ratio are displayed on the video feed.
    - A live plot visualizes the blink ratio over time.
